2024-08-15 14:45:32,114 - gptcli-session - INFO - assistant: Here's an example bash script that installs your required tools. 

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Update package lists
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# Install nvim and vim
sudo apt-get install -y neovim vim

# Install Visual Studio Code
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y code

# Install Chrome
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
rm google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

# Install Spotify
snap install spotify

#Install discord 
wget -O discord.deb "https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=linux&format=deb"
sudo dpkg -i discord.deb
rm discord.deb

# Install warp, copyq, gimp, postman, gpt-cli, obsidian (These will vary based on the source and installation method)

# Install Node.js & npm
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash

# Install GoLang
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm go1.16.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
This script is for a Debian based system (like Ubuntu). 

Please Replace the `# Install warp, copyq, gimp, postman, gpt-cli, obsidian` comment with the appropriate installation commands as those apps are not typically installed with apt-get and might require different steps based on the source and installation method.

Remember to make your script executable by using the command `chmod +x script.sh`.

Also please note that the Node.js and npm version here is 14.x, you may adjust this based on your needs and also for GoLang version is 1.16. Adjust these as needed. Always keep an eye on the versions you need.

Additionally, remember that any changes made in the bashrc file will only take effect in new terminal sessions - to use them immediately, you must either restart your terminal or execute source ~/.bashrc.
